    "on datasets. In this book, we will either generate data or use an outside source of\n",
    "datasets. Sometimes it is better to rely on generated data because we will just want to\n",
    "know the expected outcome. Most of the time, we will access public datasets for the\n",
    "given recipe and the details on accessing these are given in section 8 of this chapter.\n",
    "2. Transform and normalize data: Normally, input datasets do not come in the shape\n",
    "TensorFlow would expect so we need to transform TensorFlow them to the accepted\n",
    "shape. The data is usually not in the correct dimension or type that our algorithms\n",
    "expect. We will have to transform our data before we can use it. Most algorithms\n",
    "also expect normalized data and we will do this here as well. TensorFlow has built-in\n",
    "functions that can normalize the data for you as follows:\n",
